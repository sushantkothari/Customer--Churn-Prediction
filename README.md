# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
Customer Churn Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. By analyzing customer data, this project identifies patterns and factors that lead to customer attrition. This analysis enables businesses to implement targeted customer retention strategies.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understand the dataset's characteristics and distributions.
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, categorical data encoding, and feature scaling.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of various machine learning models to predict churn.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance assessment using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identification of key factors contributing to customer churn.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, you need Python 3.x and the following packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/sushantkothari/Customer--Churn-Prediction.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Customer--Churn-Prediction
```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or on Google Colab:
```
jupyter notebook Customer-Churn-Prediction.ipynb
```

## Data

The initial phase of the project focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics. We visualized distributions of numerical and categorical variables, highlighting differences between churned and retained customers.

## Key steps in data preprocessing included:

# Data Cleaning: Conversion of TotalCharges from an object to a numeric type, handling missing values.
# Feature Engineering: Identification of relevant features and creation of new ones to better capture customer behavior.
# Categorical Data Encoding: Transformation of categorical variables using one-hot encoding to prepare them for machine learning algorithms.
# Data Scaling: Standardization of numerical features to ensure they contribute equally to the model's performance.

## Machine Learning Models

We experimented with several machine learning models to predict customer churn, including:

- Logistic Regression: A baseline model for binary classification tasks.
- Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane for class separation.
- Gradient Boosting Classifier: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, each new model correcting errors made by previous ones.

## Model Evaluation and Feature Importance

We employed a rigorous evaluation strategy, utilizing a hold-out test set to assess model performance. This approach ensured that our evaluations reflected the models' ability to generalize to unseen data. Additionally, we analyzed feature importance scores to identify the factors most predictive of churn. This analysis provided valuable insights into customer behavior, highlighting areas where targeted interventions could significantly impact retention.

## Results

The models are evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Insights from the models inform strategies to reduce customer churn.

## Conclusion and Future Work
This project demonstrates the power of machine learning for addressing customer churn, a critical challenge in the telecommunications industry. Our findings offer actionable insights that can inform retention strategies, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.

# Future directions for this work include:

Further Model Tuning: Exploration of additional hyperparameter tuning and advanced modeling techniques to enhance performance.
Customer Segmentation: Leveraging unsupervised learning methods to identify distinct customer segments, enabling more personalized retention strategies.
Deployment: Development of a web application or API to make the churn prediction model accessible to stakeholders in real-time.
