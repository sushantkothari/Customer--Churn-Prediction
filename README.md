# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
Customer Churn Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. By analyzing customer data, this project identifies patterns and factors that lead to customer attrition. This analysis enables businesses to implement targeted customer retention strategies.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understand the dataset's characteristics and distributions.
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, categorical data encoding, and feature scaling.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of various machine learning models to predict churn.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance assessment using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identification of key factors contributing to customer churn.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, you need Python 3.x and the following packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/sushantkothari/Customer--Churn-Prediction.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Customer--Churn-Prediction
```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or on Google Colab:
```
jupyter notebook Customer-Churn-Prediction.ipynb
```

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains information about a telecom company's customers and their churn status. Key features include customer demographics, account information, and service usage.

## Models

This project explores several machine learning models, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Results

The models are evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Insights from the models inform strategies to reduce customer churn.
